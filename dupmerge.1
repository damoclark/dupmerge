.TH DUPMERGE 1
.SH NAME
dupmerge \- find duplicate files and replace with hard links
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dupmerge [-0] [-z] [-s] [-n] [-q] [-f] [-t threshold]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a list of path names from standard input and
look for duplicate contents.
When two or more copies are found, the one with the oldest modification 
time is kept and the 
other path names are recreated as hard links to the remaining copy, 
freeing up the space formerly occupied by the duplicates.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-0\fR
This option specifies that each file path name is
terminated with a null. (Use find's -print0 option to generate such a 
list.) By default, either a newline or a null will terminate a path name.

.TP
\fB\-z\fR
By default, empty files are ignored. They are often used as locks and
their inode information (owner, time, etc) is considered significant.
Disturbing them could cause problems. Besides, empty files have no
assigned blocks so there's not much to be gained by deleting them
(other than the inode entry, of course). This option causes
zero-length files to be processed like all other files; since all
zero-length files have identical contents, they will all be linked
together.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Sort the list of files by increasing size so that the smallest files
will be compared first.
By default, the list of files is sorted by decreasing size
and the largest files are examined first.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Conduct a dry run.
Dupmerge appears to operate normally without actually
unlinking or relinking any files.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR
Suppress the usual progress messages, including the unlink/link commands for each
duplicate file. Error messages are still displayed. This flag is forced 
off by the -n flag.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Enable a shortcut comparison heuristic: 
a pair of files with the same 
basename (the part of the path name after the last '/'), the same size,
and exactly the same modification timestamp will be considered identical without 
actually comparing their contents.

.TP
\fB\-t <threshold>\fR
Set the file size threshold below which files are still compared by
their hash values even when the \fB-f\fR option is set.
The default is 100,000 bytes.

.SH NOTES
After culling all non-ordinary files from the input list,
dupmerge sorts the list of ordinary files by size.
Ignoring excess hard links and files with unique sizes,
dupmerge takes the SHA-1 hash of each member of a group of two or more
distinct files of the same size
and compares the hashes to detect duplicates.
The hash operation reads each file in one large operation and caches
the result, so performance can be substantially better than
direct comparison of file pairs with frequent disk seeking between
the two.

.SH OUTPUT
Unless turned off with the \fB\-q\fR option, dupmerge lists every
duplicate file plus various statistics, such as
the number and types of files,
the number of disk blocks reclaimed from duplicates,
the number of first-page and complete-file hash function computations,
the number of hash "hits" (references to hash values that have already 
been computed),
and the number of same-size file pairs whose first page hashes match but
differ in their full-file hashes.
